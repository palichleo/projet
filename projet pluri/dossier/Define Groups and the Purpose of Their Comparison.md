### **Define Groups and the Purpose of Their Comparison**

#### Groups:

1. **Young mice on a standard diet (Group 1)**: Baseline for age-related changes.
2. **Middle-aged mice on a standard diet (Group 2)**: Control for natural aging effects.
3. **Middle-aged mice on a high-fat diet (Group 3)**: Test the impact of high-fat diet on aging-related changes.
4. **Middle-aged mice on a calorie-restricted diet (Group 4)**: Test the protective effects of calorie restriction on aging-related changes.

#### Specific Group Comparisons:

1. **Group 1 vs. Group 2**: Assess the effects of aging on behavior and brain structure.
2. **Group 2 vs. Group 3**: Determine the impact of a high-fat diet on aging-related declines.
3. **Group 2 vs. Group 4**: Evaluate the protective effects of calorie restriction against aging-related declines.
4. **Group 3 vs. Group 4**: Directly compare high-fat diet and calorie restriction to determine their opposing effects on aging-related changes.

### Independent, Dependent, and Controlled Variables

- Independent Variable:
  - Diet type (standard, high-fat, calorie-restricted).
  - Age of mice (young vs. middle-aged).
- Dependent Variables:
  - Behavioral measures: motor functions, anxiety, memory, and olfaction.
  - Physiological measures: hippocampus volume via MRI and weight changes.
- Controlled Variables:
  - Species and strain of mice.
  - Experimental conditions (duration of treatment, environment).
  - Test protocols for behavioral and physiological assessments.
